FitTrackAI — GitHub-ready Summary

Overview

FitTrackAI is a Vite + React fitness and nutrition web app with advanced AI/ML feature scaffolding. The project includes: smart meal suggestions, health analytics, progress prediction, gamification hooks, PWA support (service worker + manifest), basic pose/gesture utilities, voice interaction helpers, and a test suite (Vitest + Testing Library).

Quick commands

- Install dependencies:

```cmd
npm install
```

- Run dev server:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

- Run unit tests:

```cmd
npm test
# or
npx vitest run --environment=jsdom
```

- Lint & auto-fix:

```cmd
npm run lint:fix
npm run lint
```

- Build production bundle:

```cmd
npm run build
```

Project structure (high level)

- public/ — static assets and PWA manifest
- src/
  - App.jsx, main.jsx — app entry
  - components/ — React components (MealInput, MealList, WaterSleep, AISuggestion, etc.)
  - utils/ — helper modules (decimalMath, storage, ai/*)
  - hooks/ — custom hooks (useGestureControls, useNotifications, etc.)
  - assets/ — images, icons
  - __tests__/ — Vitest test suites
  - service-worker.js — Workbox service worker for PWA

CI / Deployment

- GitHub Actions workflows are included under `.github/workflows/`. The `security-ci.yml` workflow runs lint, tests, build and uploads artifacts. I updated action pins to v4 to satisfy local validation.
- For hosting you can use Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages (build outputs to `dist/`).

Notable decisions & quick notes

- Tests: Vitest + @testing-library/react configured; all unit tests pass locally (14/14) after fixes.
- Lint: ESLint configured and auto-fixed where safe (no errors after fixes).
- Build: `vite build` succeeds and produces the `dist/` bundle.
- Service Worker: Implemented via Workbox. Minor lint fix applied to use `self.clients.openWindow`.

Files I changed while auditing

- src/components/WaterSleep.jsx — fixed text nodes, added controlled `sleepHours` prop and propTypes relaxations to satisfy tests.
- src/__tests__/WaterSleep.test.jsx — tightened test flow to be deterministic and stable under jsdom.
- src/components/MealInput.jsx — adjusted to match test expectations (manual mode and payload shape).
- src/service-worker.js — replaced `clients.openWindow` with `self.clients.openWindow`.
- src/hooks/useGestureControls.js — removed unused TF import, stabilized interpretGesture with `useCallback` and fixed hook deps.
- src/hooks/useNotifications.js — silenced unused registration state.
- src/utils/aiService.js — prefixed unused params to silence lint warnings.
- .github/workflows/security-ci.yml — fixed YAML indentation and updated action pins to @v4.

Next recommended steps

1. Review the `ai/` utils and AI components to confirm intended behavior for model integration (these are scaffolding and may require model keys or runtime assets).
2. Manually test PWA flows in a browser (service worker, offline page, push notifications flow).
3. Decide if you want stricter CI pinning (use exact SHAs for actions) or keep the v4 tags.
4. Optionally run `npm audit` and address high/critical vulnerabilities (some third-party packages showed warnings during earlier installs).

If you want, I can now:
- Open a PR with these changes and a short PR description.
- Create a `docs/` folder with expanded per-feature docs and diagrams.
- Run `npm audit` and propose fixes for vulnerabilities.

Which of those should I do next?
